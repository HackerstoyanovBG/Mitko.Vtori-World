# Mitko.Vtori personal blog

This is my first website.
It was just a school homework but after I made it I decided to create something cool.
I'll send some parts of the code here.
For now I won't leave a link to the site, I would like to finish it.

the code is mainaly HTML & CSS but maybe in the feature, I will add real languages like JavaScript, Python & C#.
